# Quad's Site

My personal website. It contains JavaScript although it's completely unnecessary. Mostly done for learning purposes. It's my first time doing Ajax so sorry if the implementation is cancerous.

Contains a bunch of pretty ugly CSS "hacks" to try and get the main content block centered on most displays. Tried doing it without the old transformY(); trick or Flexbox.

I know jack about JavaScript, so I know it works on the most recent Firefox, because that's the browser I use. But I won't be bothered to test it on any other browsers unless I switch browsers myself.
